/*
Write a Java program A1p1.java with a public class A1p1 and no named packages. The program should take two command line arguments assumed to be integers a and b (with a<b) and print the integers a,a+3,a+6,a+9,â€¦,(up to b). Each line should contain five integers separated by commas with no comma after the last integer on each line (the last line is allowed to contain less than five integers). Further, if any integer is a multiple of 7, it should be printed between a pair of curly braces. Two sample runs look like the following (Note: in sample runs, blue color means those typed by the user while others are displayed by the program or the command window itself):
[kwang@computer][~/temp]$ java A1p1 5 47
5,8,11,{14},17
20,23,26,29,32
{35},38,41,44,47
[kwang@computer][~/temp]$ java A1p1 -3 59
-3,{0},3,6,9
12,15,18,{21},24
27,30,33,36,39
{42},45,48,51,54
57
