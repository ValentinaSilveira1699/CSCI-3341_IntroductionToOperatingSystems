CSCI 3341 Assignment 2 (Pointer and some C Practices)

deadline --- 11:30PM Feb 1, Thursday, 2024.

1.	(20 points) What is the output of the following C program? If you believe there is a compile error or runtime error, you should point out all the errors. You should be able to tell the answer without compiling or running it.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int x=6;
	int *q=&x;
	x+=1; (*q)+=2; 
	int y=x*((*q)-1);
	printf("y is %d\n",y);
	return 0;
}

Answer:
Output: y is 72

2. (20 points) What is the output of the following C program? If you believe there is a compile error or runtime error, you should point out all the errors. You should be able to tell the answer without compiling or running it.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int x=6;
	int *q=&x, &qq=*x;
	(*q)-=2; (*qq)+=3;
	int y=(*qq)*((*q)-2);
	printf("y is %d\n",y);
	return 0;
}

Answer:
There are errors in the provided C program:
- In the line int *q=&x, &qq=*x; the second part &qq=*x; is attempting to assign the value of *x to &qq, which is incorrect. 
It should be: int *q=&x, *qq=&x;

- In the line (*q)-=2; (*qq)+=3; is  trying to dereference qq and increment its value. However, qq is a pointer.
The correct way should be: (*q)-=2; (*qq)+=3;
 
3. (20 points) What is the output of the following C program? If you believe there is a compile error or runtime error, you should point out all the errors. You should be able to tell the answer without compiling or running it.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int x=23,y=8;
	int q=x/y,r=x%y,r2=(x>y);
	double v=(double)x/y;
	printf("q=%d,r=%d,r2=%d,v=%f\n",q,r,r2,v);
	return 0;
}

Answer:
Output: q=2,r=7,r2=1,v=2.875000

4. (20 points) What is the output of the following C program? Point out all the errors if you believe there are any compile errors or potential runtime errors. You should be able to tell the answer without compiling or running it.
#include <stdio.h>
void myfun(char a[], int size) {
char t, *p, *q;
p=a; q=a+size-1;
     while(p<q) {
     t=*p; *p=*q; *q=t;
     p++; q--;
   	}//while
}//myfun
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   char a[10];
	int i;
for(i=0;i<10;i++) a[i]='e'+i; 
myfun(a,10);
	for(i=0;i<10;i++) printf("%c",a[i]); printf("\n");
	return 0;
}//main

Answer:
Output: nmlkjihgfe

5. (20 points) What is the output of the following C program? Point out all the errors if you believe there are any compile errors or potential runtime errors. You should be able to tell the answer without compiling or running it.
#include <stdio.h>
void swap(char *p, char *q) {
char *t;
     t=p; p=q; q=t;
}//swap
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   char a[10];
	int i;
for(i=0;i<10;i++) a[i]='e'+i; 
	for(i=0;i<5;i++) swap(&a[i],&a[9-i]); 
printf("%c%c\n",a[0],a[9]);
	return 0;
}//main

Answer:
Output: en
